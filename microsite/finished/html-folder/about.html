                (study by University of Toronto).<br>
                characters used the emphasized word "so" to modify adjectives
                more often than any other intensifier.</p>
              <p>Joey's catchphrase, <strong>"How you doin'?"</strong>,<br>
                 became a popular part of Western English slang,
                 often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends</p>
              <p>Friends has also developed an <strong>alternative family lifestyle</strong> by
                representing young people that live unconventional domestic lives.</p>
