        <span class="chorus">My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send <br>
        And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers <br>
        We could be friends <br>
        I just need a way out of my head <br>
        I'll do anything for a way out <br>

        <span class="dsc">[Verse]</span><br>
        In my own way, this feel like living <br>
        Some alternate reality <br>
        And I was just drowning, but now I'm swimming <br>
        Through stressful waters to relief <br>
        Yeah, all the things I'd do <br>
        To spend a little time in hell <br>
        And what I won't tell you <br>
        I'll prolly never even tell myself <br><br>
        <span class="dsc">[Bridge]</span><br>
        And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right <br>
        When you inside all day <br>
        I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain <br>
        Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever <br>
        They told me it only gets better <br> <br>
        <span class="dsc">[Chorus]</span><br>
        <span class="chorus">My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send <br>
        And I got neighbor's, they more like strangers <br>
        We could be friends <br>
        I just need a way out of my head <br>
        I'll do anything for a way out <br>
        Of my head</span></p>
